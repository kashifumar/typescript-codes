## to test this, run following commands

## To Speed up testing during development, two packages are used

## https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon

nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

nodemon does not require any additional changes to your code or method of development. nodemon is a replacement wrapper for node. To use nodemon, replace the word node on the command line when executing your script.

## https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently

Run multiple commands concurrently. Like npm run watch-js & npm run watch-less but better.

## These two are configured in package.json in the scripts section
